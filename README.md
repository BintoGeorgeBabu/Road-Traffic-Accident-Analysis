# **Road Traffic Accident Analysis**

## Overview

This project analyzes road traffic accidents in the UK using Python and SQL. The goal is to identify patterns, assess risk factors, and develop predictive models to improve road safety. The dataset used is the UK's 2020 accident database, which contains detailed accident records, vehicle information, casualty details, and geographic data.

## Features
- Data extraction and cleaning using Python (Pandas, NumPy)

- SQL queries for data retrieval and aggregation

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for pattern identification

- Machine learning techniques (Apriori algorithm, clustering, and Random Forest) for insights and prediction

- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

- Outlier detection and feature engineering

## Technologies Used

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

- SQL: SQLite

- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis

- Machine Learning: Apriori Algorithm, K-Means Clustering, Random Forest

## Key Findings

1. Accident Severity: 78% of accidents were minor, 20% serious, and 1.5% fatal.

2. Demographics: Most accidents involved drivers aged 21-45, with a higher proportion of male drivers and casualties.

3. Time-based Trends: Peak accident hours were 3-5 PM, with Fridays being the most accident-prone day.

4. Motorbike Accidents: Highest between 2-6 PM, with 50cc-125cc bikes being most affected.

5. Pedestrian Accidents: Most occurred during rush hours (3-6 PM), peaking at 3 PM.

6. Weather and Light Conditions: Over 70% of accidents occurred in fine weather during daylight.

7. Machine Learning Insights:

   - Apriori Algorithm: Found associations between speed limits, urban settings, and minor accidents.

   - Clustering: Identified accident-prone areas in major cities (Hull, Grimsby, Scunthorpe, etc.).

   - Random Forest Model: Achieved high accuracy in classifying accident severity but had lower precision in predicting fatal accidents.

## Recommendations

- Peak Hour Interventions: Deploy traffic management strategies between 3-5 PM.

- Speed Limit Enforcement: Enhance enforcement in urban areas with high accident rates.

- Motorbike Safety Measures: Improve infrastructure and awareness for motorbikes, especially over 500cc.

- Pedestrian Safety Improvements: Install better pedestrian road signs, illuminated crossings, and safety infrastructure.
